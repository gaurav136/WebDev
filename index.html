                    Just as we see many software companies thriving because the software stack is free and open-source,
                    RISC-V has made hardware architecture free and open-source, allowing anyone to develop hardware.
                    This innovation positions RISC-V as the future of computing.

            <p class="sectionTag text-mid">Why Risc-V?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">CPU design requires design expertise in several specialties: electronic
                digital logic, compilers, and operating systems. To cover the costs of such a team, commercial vendors
                of processor intellectual property (IP), such as Arm Ltd. and MIPS Technologies, charge royalties for
                the use of their designs and patents. They also often require non-disclosure agreements
                before releasing documents that describe their designs' detailed advantages. In many cases, they never
                describe the reasons for their design choices.

                RISC-V was begun with a goal to make a practical ISA that was open-sourced, usable academically, and
                deployable in any hardware or software design without royalties.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Ls a RISC architecture, the RISC-V ISA is a load-store architecture. Its
                floating-point instructions use IEEE 754 floating-point. Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include:
                instruction bit field locations chosen to simplify the use of multiplexers in a CPU, a design
                that is architecturally neutral, and a fixed location for the sign bit of immediate
                values to speed up sign extension.

                The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. The base instruction set has a fixed length of
                32-bit naturally aligned instructions, and the ISA supports variable length extensions where each
                instruction can be any number of 16-bit parcels in length.Extensions support small embedded
                systems, personal computers, supercomputers with vector processors, and warehouse-scale parallel
                computers.
